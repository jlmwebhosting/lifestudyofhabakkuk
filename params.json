{"name":"Lifestudyofhabakkuk","tagline":"","body":"Welcome to Life Study of Habakkuk\r\n\r\nA. The Meaning of the Name Habakkuk\r\nThe name Habakkuk in Hebrew means \"embracing\" or \"clinging to,\" signifying that we need to seek God by embracing Him or clinging to Him. For us to receive God's eternal salvation, we need to be embraced by God, and we need to cling to Him.\r\nEternal salvation is actually God Himself. God does not save us by remaining in the heavens and stretching out His arm to reach the earth. In order to save us, God became a man on this earth and came to us. The central thought of the four Gospels is that the saving God came out of eternity into time, out of the heavens to earth, and out of divinity into humanity to be a man. In this way He could embrace man and man could cling to Him.\r\nWhile God was saving us, He was not in the appearance, the form, of God. Rather, He was in the form of a man named Jesus. Hosea 11:4 tells us that God draws us with the cords of a man, with the bands of love. The saving cords of love are Christ's humanity. The account of Zaccheus in Luke 19:1-10 shows us the way God saves us by coming to us. In order to be saved by God, we must be embraced by God and we must cling to Him.\r\n\r\n The Kernel, the Intrinsic Part,\r\nof the Old Testament\r\nChrist is revealed in the Old Testament by the types, the prophecies, the historical writings, and the Psalms. The types of Christ, the prophecies concerning Christ, and the historical writings do not need to be purified, but we must study the Psalms in a purifying way. Among the first forty-one psalms, only seven present a clear revelation of Christ (Psa. 2, 8, 16, 22â€”24, 40). Psalm 1 is good, but it is good according to the natural concept. Still, this psalm is necessary, for without it, how could the beauty of Psalm 2 be manifested?\r\nLet us use an orange tree as an illustration. In order to grow, an orange needs not only its peel but also the whole tree with the roots, the trunk, the branches, and the leaves. However, none of these should be eaten. Actually, to eat or drink, the only thing we need is the orange juice. This illustration points to something crucial related to the enjoyment of Christ, the eating of Christ. In order to see Christ in reality, we need all one hundred fifty of the psalms, but to enjoy Christ, to feed on Christ, we need to come to the revelation of Christ in the Psalms.\r\nThe Bible is the divine speaking, but this divine speaking is not something that has come directly by God Himself. This speaking is by God through man. For instance, God charged David to speak what is in Psalm 2, but because David was full of opinions and concepts and because he loved the law to the uttermost, he spoke Psalm 1. He added something of his own. Today when we come to the Bible, we may not know what is the real message and what is the human addition. This may be our situation when we come to the Minor Prophets. In these books there are some human concepts. When Jonah was angry with God and argued with God, he was expressing his own human concept. The vital point here is that whereas the entire Bible is the divine revelation, it is the kernel, the intrinsic part, that is good for eating and drinking to nourish us.\r\n\r\nFirst, we have the prophet's song in prayer (vv. 1-2). In his prayer he asked Jehovah to revive His work in those years (vv. 1-2a), and he asked Him to make it known in those years that He will remember compassion in wrath.\r\n\r\nAll these verses seem very good, but for the most part they express Habakkuk's natural concept, without much revelation of Christ. Even Habakkuk's concept of trusting in Jehovah during a time of need was natural. There is no comparison between these verses and Paul's writings. Paul's concept was different. When he was troubled, he prayed three times, but the Lord told him that He would not remove the thorn and that His grace was sufficient for him (2 Cor. 12:7-10). When Paul was short of food, he did not \"trust\" in the Lord in the way Habakkuk did; rather, he took the opportunity to fast. In a very real sense, he did not need to trust in the Lord, for he was in the Lord already, and the Lord was in him. Furthermore, instead of trying to keep the law, he lived Christ (Gal. 2:20; Phil. 1:21a).\r\n\r\nWhereas many Christians appreciate verses such as Habakkuk 3:17-19a, we need to be brought into another realm, the realm of Christ. These verses are not according to the divine revelation concerning Christ but according to the prophet's natural, human, and religious concept. If we are brought into the realm of Christ, we will not appreciate the natural, religious thought expressed in much of the Old Testament. Rather, we will treasure the divine revelation in the Word. Moreover, instead of \"trusting\" in the Lord like Habakkuk did, we will see that the crucial matter is not trusting but realizing that we are in Christ and that Christ is in us.\r\n\r\nConcerning prayer, we should take Paul as our example, not Habakkuk. Paul did not pray for common things. On the contrary, he prayed that \"the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him\" (Eph. 1:17). We all need to have our view uplifted.\r\n\r\nA. The Meaning\r\nof the Name Zephaniah\r\nThe name Zephaniah in Hebrew means \"Jah hides\" or \"Jah treasures,\" probably signifying to be hidden by Jehovah as His treasure in the day of His anger (2:3). In the day of God's anger, we need to be the treasure hidden in Him.\r\nIn 1:1 we are told that Zephaniah was \"the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah.\" As a descendant of Hezekiah, a good king, Zephaniah was a royal descendant. One of his ancestors was another good king, Josiah.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
